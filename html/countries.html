            <p>
              Turkey is a country that connects Europe with the Middle East.
              Turkey has played a rather difficult role in history. A large
              number of wars took place on this land, which was accompanied by a
              change in the local population. More than two thousand ancient
              settlements are located on the territory of Turkey. The history of
              the peoples of Turkey began about 10 thousand years ago. An
              important role was played by the Greeks, who occupied this land in
              the XIV-XII centuries BC, their most important contribution was
              the development of trade and navigation. Later on the land of
              Turkey there were many colonies, and in the VIII century BC. e.
              the Phrygians and Libyans came here. Beginning from the VI century
              BC e., after multiple raids, the Persians began to rule. Today,
              rest in Turkey takes a leading position among tourist destinations
              ...

              Egypt is an amazing country shrouded in the secrets of the ancient

              pyramids or the beautiful coral gardens of the Red Sea, will not
              be delighted. Going on a trip to Egypt, you can touch with your
              own hands the thousand-year-old tombs of the pharaohs who ruled
              Upper and Lower Egypt, visit the titanic ruins, the temples of
              Kornak and Luxor, as well as buy ancient and unusual gizmos.

              The UAE is a deserts with blooming gardens, warm waters of the

              Arab Emirates is an opportunity to plunge into oriental exoticism,
              see picturesque landscapes, learn the cultural and national
              characteristics of an interesting country. In the days of nomadic
              tribes, the wealth of these places was only in golden sands and
              azure waters. With the advent of civilization and technological
              progress, it became clear that at the bottom of the ocean near the
              UAE there is "black gold" - oil, which is much more valuable than
              gold dunes. Thanks to the discovery of oil, this country began to
              develop very quickly and today a lot of tourists are striving to
              get to the Arab Emirates.
